    "AC3.1 Examine Information for Validity\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Validity is the term used to describe the strength and accuracy of information, which can be assessed by considering factors such as bias, opinion, circumstance, currency, and accuracy. A diverse array of sources of information, including judgements, trial transcripts, media reports, and evidence, significantly influence legal cases.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Evidence is a crucial element of legal proceedings, frequently serving as the basis for convictions. In the case of Jim Allen, the prosecution's argument was primarily based on forensic evidence, which included fingerprints on window frames and residues of his blood on the exterior window and kitchen bench. However, the validity of this evidence is uncertain. The police's interpretation of the evidence to correlate with their preconceived conceptions is evident in their reliance on Mr. Allen's prior burglary convictions to construct a case against him. It is inconclusive whether his fingerprints were present at the site, as they could have been present as a natural consequence of his employment as a window cleaner. In the same vein, the reliability and accuracy of the forensic team's findings were compromised by their failure to properly encapsulate items, which led to the mismanagement of evidence. Defective forensic evidence also resulted in a perversion of justice in the case of Sally Clark. Sir Roy Meadow's assertion that the probability of two neonates dying of natural causes was \"1 in 73 million\" had a substantial impact on the jury, despite its statistical inaccuracy. This illustrates the potential for forensic evidence that has been negligently handled or biassed to undermine the validity of a case.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "It is imperative that judgements are based on reliable information and are impartial. In the case of Mr. Allen, the judge referred to him as a \"calculated criminal\" and \"evil to the core,\" which implies bias and an opinion-based judgement rather than an impartial assessment of the facts. The media's intensive portrayal of Mr. Allen as culpable likely compromised the impartiality of the jury's verdict, which likely influenced their decision. In the same vein, the Hillsborough tragedy case serves as an illustration of the potential for biassed and defective evidence to lead to invalid judgements. The victims were initially classified as \"football hooligans,\" and the initial inquest established that the deaths were incidental, despite the existence of evidence of police negligence. The distorting effects of biassed narratives and errors in judgement on justice were not underscored until years later, when a new inquest determined that the victims were unlawfully murdered.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Trial transcripts, which are verbatim recordings of court proceedings, are generally considered genuine sources due to their objectivity and precision. However, the transcripts' validity may be brought into question in Mr. Allen's case due to procedural deficiencies. For example, Mr. Allen was denied access to legal representation during his initial police interview, which could have influenced his statements and violated his rights. Circumstances such as these can affect the transcripts' reliability and the trial's overall impartiality. In contrast, the trial transcripts' importance in the Stephen Lawrence case is emphasised by their capacity to detect inaccuracies. These transcripts provided essential insights into police failures, which in turn facilitated future legal action and exposed systemic biases in the justice system.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Media reports have a significant impact on the perceptions of the public and the jury; however, they are often biassed and inaccurate. Mr. Allen was portrayed as culpable by media agencies, who emphasised his criminal record and portrayed the police as ineffectual. This biassed narrative likely influenced the jury and public opinion, resulting in a biassed environment for the trial. In the same vein, the media's portrayal of the Caroline Flack case exacerbated a negative public narrative by accentuating sensational aspects of her personal life rather than the facts. The relentless media scrutiny that surrounded her case further exacerbated the circumstances, demonstrating the potential impact of biassed reporting on outcomes and validity.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "In conclusion, the validity of information in legal cases, such as Mr. Allen's, is contingent upon the objectivity, accuracy, and context of the information. Procedural violations, biassed judgements, defective forensic procedures, and sensationalised media coverage significantly undermined the reliability of the evidence against him. This section demonstrates the potential for distorting justice through the use of public narratives, mismanagement of evidence, and bias by drawing comparisons to cases such as Sally Clark, Hillsborough, Stephen Lawrence, and Caroline Flack. It is essential to reevaluate such cases to ensure that valid information is utilised to achieve equitable outcomes.\n\n" +

    "Draw Conclusions from the Information in AC3.2\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Verdicts That Are Fair\n\n" +

    "A verdict that is properly and legally rendered is referred to as a \"just verdict.\" It can be a lengthy process to reach a verdict that is both just and deserved in trials that conclude with an unjust verdict.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Private prosecutions against Luke Knight, Neil Acourt, and Gary Dobson were initiated by Stephen Lawrence's family in 1994. Because the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) did not initiate the prosecution, it was classified as a private prosecution. This initial prosecution was primarily predicated on the testimony of Stephen's acquaintance, Duwayne. Ultimately, the verdict was acquittal, as the testimonial evidence was inadequate, resulting in the case's collapse. This was an unjust verdict, as the family of Stephen Lawrence was not granted justice.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Sir William MacPherson's 350-page MacPherson report, which was published in February 1999, was the result of a 1997 inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. The report examined institutional prejudice within the police and resulted in numerous modifications, such as the repeal of the \"double jeopardy\" law, which previously prohibited the retrial of an individual for the same offence.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Later, a microscopic bloodstain pertaining to Stephen Lawrence was discovered on Gary Dobson's overcoat, providing new evidence. This was followed by the initiation of an additional trial with the objective of convicting two of Stephen's murderers. The verdict delivered this time was guilty. It is a fair verdict in a sense, as some of the individuals culpable for his murder were brought to justice. Nevertheless, it remains unjust that only two of the five potential culpable parties were convicted of their offences.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "In the case of R v Ponting, he was on trial for disclosing documents regarding the sinking of an Argentinian battleship to an MP. He argued that it was in the interest of the state'. During the trial, the judge had advised the jury to render a guilty verdict, as he had violated the Official Secrets Act. However, in an act of jury nullification, they reached a not guilty verdict. The verdict is justifiable, as the information he disclosed was in the public interest and related to the Royal Navy's superfluous and illicit sinking of a ship.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "The HMS Vengeance submarine and its instruments were damaged in 2000, and Rosie James and Rachel Wenham were acquitted of criminal damage. They pleaded not guilty despite admitting to their actions, as they believed the submarine posed a threat to the occupants of the surrounding area. Like the Ponting case, this was also a just verdict, as their actions were justified under international law and were taken in the interest of others.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Miscarriages of Justice\n\n" +

    "There is a higher incidence of miscarriages of justice than is commonly believed, as evidenced by a variety of cases.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Derek Bentley was prosecuted for the murder of two police officers with his companion. Subsequently, the 19-year-old was executed after serving a decade in prison. The Court of Appeal in 1989 vacated the convictions of the Guildford Four for two IRA explosive explosions in Guildford, after they had spent 14 years in prison. In addition, the Birmingham Six were erroneously convicted of the murder of 21 individuals following the explosion of explosives in Birmingham, and they were incarcerated for 17 years. Stefan Kiszko was convicted of the sexual homicide of a juvenile girl and was forced to serve 16 years in prison before being released. Stephen Downing was sentenced to 27 years in prison for a homicide that he admitted to, despite numerous police failings. This prison sentence is the longest in Britain. Finally, Sean Hodgson was convicted of murder after confessing to the crime; however, he was an inveterate liar and should not have been imprisoned at all.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Based on the analysis and examination of cases, it is evident that miscarriages of justice do occur. This is driven in part by police misconduct. For example, in the case of Derek Bentley, the police misinterpreted the phrase \"let him have it,\" which Bentley used to instruct his companion Craig to surrender the pistol. This was distorted by the police, who claimed that Bentley was inciting Craig to fire the police officers, and as a result, Bentley was responsible for the murdered. Additionally, a police witness who was of great importance fabricated an account while under oath. Police misconduct was also evident in the Guildford Four case, as the suspects were subjected to severe coercion by the police, including intimidation, torture, and threats to their families. The four confessed to homicide as a result of the ruthless nature of their interrogation methods and the police's pressure to convict. The Birmingham Six were similarly subjected to a targeted stop-and-search operation by a specialised police branch. Because of this, the six were subjected to physical assault by the police and were deprived of food and sleep while in custody. Like the Guildford Four, the six were subjected to threats and physical abuse during their 12-hour interrogation without a pause, which suggests that they may have also experienced exhaustion.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "The police also neglected to allow a solicitor to be present during the intensive two-day interrogation in the Stefan Kiszko case, which led to Stefan confessing to the crime. This evidence corroborates my assertion that police misconduct does occur, which in turn leads to miscarriages of justice within our criminal justice system. This demonstrates that the system is occasionally unjust.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "An additional conclusion that I can derive is that the mental health of suspects is frequently disregarded, resulting in miscarriages of justice. For example, Derek Bentley was deemed unfit to stand trial due to his borderline retardation and illiteracy, as he possessed the mental capacity of an 11-year-old. In the same vein, Stephen Downing, who possessed the mental capacity of an 11-year-old and suffered from severe learning disabilities, would have been unable to comprehend the nuances of his interrogation in the absence of his solicitor. In addition to these, Sean Hodgson confessed to the murder of a woman, despite his pathological liar status, and this was not taken into account in court. This supports my assertion that police misconduct can also include disregarding the mental health and capacity of their suspects, which can result in justice errors. This serves to illustrate that the criminal justice system is not consistent in its fairness.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "I am also able to infer that miscarriages of justice are primarily the result of evidence, as evidenced by the Guildford Four's admission of culpability, which they subsequently retracted, claiming that they had only confessed as a result of torture. Later, it was disclosed that the authorities were not informed of the evidence that would have cleared the four. In the Birmingham Six case, the forensic evidence that was initially used to determine affirmative results for explosives handling was subsequently overturned. The judge stated that the convictions were unsafe and inadequate following the discovery of new evidence. Evidence that would have cleared the suspects was withheld until a subsequent retrial in both of these instances. Stefan Kiszko was unable to leave sperm at the site, as scientific evidence determined, and as a result, he was ruled out as the perpetrator. Similarly, Sean Hodgson was exonerated during the DNA analysis of the crime site, as it was determined that he was not the perpetrator. I am convinced that evidence is a significant factor in miscarriages of justice, and that the criminal justice system will never be fair until these issues are resolved.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "There are numerous instances of these miscarriages of justice that are simply unfixable. For example, Derek Bentley was executed in 1953, years prior to his acquittal, and as a result, justice can never be denied. Before his conviction was overturned in 1992, Stefan Kiszko was incarcerated for 16 years. Nevertheless, he passed away in 1993, and as a result, he spent the majority of his life in prison. Similarly, Sean Hodgson was released from prison in 2009 and passed away in 2012. Things have been made right for a few instances of just ice, though. The Birmingham Six were granted their freedom in 1991 after their second appeal, while the Guildford Four had their convictions annulled by the Court of Appeal in 1989 and have since led ordinary lives. In both instances, they were granted the opportunity to relive their lives. This leads me to the conclusion that the majority of miscarriages of justice are irremediable, and individuals frequently continue to exist in the shadow of their convictions. Thus, the criminal justice system remains primarily unjust, despite its efforts to rectify its inequities.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "From these cases, it is evident that the criminal justice system has undergone changes in order to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which was introduced in 1974, was the result of the Guildford Four's acquittal. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) was another act that was introduced in response to a miscarriage of justice resulting from the Stephen Downing case. It was recommended by PACE that the methods employed by law enforcement be made public, and that defendants who have been arrested be informed of their rights. Due to technological advancements, it is exceedingly unlikely that the case of Stephen Kiszko and his miscarriage of justice will happen again. Finally, the criminal justice system and convictions were altered in the case of Sean Hodgson as a result of the use of investigative techniques such as DNA. I can infer from these developments that the criminal justice system is making an effort to prevent as many miscarriages of justice as possible; however, it is impossible to disregard the fact that they continue to occur.\n\n" +

    "Safe Verdicts\n\n" +

    "An unsafe verdict is achieved when a jury's verdict of \"guilty\" is called into doubt, but it is not formally altered by retrial. Therefore, a safe verdict is determined by examining all of the facts of the case, evaluating the admissible evidence, and adhering to the appropriate trial procedure to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "The West Midlands Serious Crime Squad was employed in the Birmingham Six case; however, it was discontinued shortly thereafter under allegations of misconduct. It is conceivable that they were accountable for numerous unsafe verdicts, as they were required to investigate the crimes and subsequently prosecute them prior to the establishment of the CPS. This meant that they could potentially manufacture evidence or influence a suspect's confession. After the Criminal Offences Act of 1985, which resulted in the establishment of the CPS, the majority of these issues were resolved. More than 100 convictions have been overturned over the years as a result of unsafe verdicts, as the evidence and treatment of the suspects were often unjust.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Dr. Frank Skuse, who was also an involved in the Birmingham Six case, was responsible for numerous unsafe verdicts, frequently as a result of his explosives-related evidence. In the Birmingham Six case, Dr. Skuse had employed the Griess test to assert that two of the men, Patrick Hill and William Power, had been handling explosives as a result of the presence of nitroglycerine on their hands. Nevertheless, Skuse's test was discovered to have used an incorrect concentration of solution, which was essential for obtaining precise results. This implied that the strong solution would react favourably with a variety of compounds, not just nitroglycerin. Consequently, the only conclusion that could be drawn from this was that they could have been managing commonplace objects such as soap or playing cards. Due to the unreliability of the evidence upon which they were convicted, the guilty verdict was deemed to be unsafe.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Just Sentencing\n\n" +

    "The term \"just sentencing\" denotes sentences that are both legal and accurate in relation to the offence in question. Magistrates are provided with sentencing guidelines, which are intended to ensure that the same crimes are senteced consistently throughout the nation. Nevertheless, despite the existence of these guidelines, not all sentencing is uniform. Jacqueline Martin, for instance, discovered that 11% of cases heard at Bristol magistrates resulted in custodial sentences, whereas this figure was only 1% in Wales. Again, in Bristol, 33% of cases heard at the magistrates' courts resulted in community sentences; however, this figure was only 6% in Dinefwr, Wales. Therefore, the \"unduly lenient sentencing scheme\" enables the public to refer a sentence that is exceedingly lenient to the Court of Appeal in the expectation that it will be resolved.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "Stuart Hall was convicted of 14 counts of sexual abuse against minors, all of whom were females between the ages of nine and seventeen. At first, he was sentenced to 15 months in prison, which was deemed unjust given the severity of his offences. The Attorney General's office determined that the sentence was \"unduly lenient,\" and it was then increased to 30 months. As a result of his subsequent conviction for indecent assault, he was sentenced to an additional two years and six months in prison.\n\n" +

    "\n\n" +

    "The 2011 London riots created a moral crisis in the city, and in order to demonstrate that the harm inflicted would not be repeated, the sentences for offences committed during this period were increased by 25%. For instance, \"two men were sentenced to four years in prison for using Facebook to incite riots,\" while another was sentenced to 18 months for concealing a stolen television in his vehicle. The sentences were disproportionate to the offences committed, so this was not just sentencing.\n\n"
