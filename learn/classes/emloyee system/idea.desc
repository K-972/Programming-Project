Project Idea: Employee Management System

Description:
Create an employee management system where you can store and manage information about employees in a company. The system should allow you to add new employees, update their information, view employee details, and perform other operations.

Features to Implement:

Employee Class: Create a base class called Employee with attributes such as name, age, position, salary, etc. Include methods to set and get employee details.

Subclasses: Implement subclasses for different types of employees (e.g., Manager, Developer, Designer). Each subclass should inherit from the Employee class and may have additional attributes or methods specific to that type of employee.

Add Employee: Implement a feature to add new employees to the system. Prompt the user to enter details such as name, age, position, and salary.

Update Employee Details: Allow the user to update employee details such as position, salary, etc. Prompt the user to select an employee and then provide options to update specific attributes.

View Employee Details: Display a list of all employees in the system along with their details. Include options to view details for a specific employee.

Search Employee: Implement a feature to search for employees by name, position, or any other criteria.

Remove Employee: Allow the user to remove an employee from the system. Prompt the user to select an employee to delete.

Save and Load Data: Implement functionality to save employee data to a file (e.g., CSV, JSON) and load it back when the program starts.

Additional Features (Optional):

Error handling: Handle input validation and errors gracefully.
Sorting: Implement sorting options to sort employees based on different criteria (e.g., name, age, salary).
GUI: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter to make the system more user-friendly.
Sample Workflow:

User launches the program and sees a menu with options like "Add Employee", "Update Employee", etc.
User selects an option, such as "Add Employee", and enters the details for the new employee.
User can then choose to view, update, or remove employees as needed.
