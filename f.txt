AC 1.1 - Evaluate the effectiveness of the roles of personnel involved in criminal investigations.

Crime Scene Investigators (CSIs) or Scene of Crime Officers (SOCOs) play a critical role in criminal investigations. Police services employ them to preserve and protect crime scenes, recover evidence, and ensure its uncontaminated and reliable use in legal proceedings.
To become a SOCO, individuals typically need a degree in forensic science or a related scientific field. SOCOs also highly value experience in police work, intelligence gathering, and analysis. On average, SOCOs work about 42 hours per week and earn salaries ranging from £16,000 to £35,000 per year. One major strength of SOCOs is their expertise and experience, which make them trustworthy professionals. Their specialized knowledge minimizes the risk of evidence contamination and enhances the accuracy of their findings, which is crucial for securing prosecutions.
Another advantage is their availability. Every police force in England and Wales employs SOCOs, who operate on an on-call system. This ensures they are always ready to assist in investigations. A notable example of their effectiveness is the Sally Bowman case, where SOCOs collected DNA evidence that identified the perpetrator despite a lack of initial suspects. Their cost-effectiveness is another strength. With salaries between £16,000 and £35,000, SOCOs are relatively affordable for police departments and government budgets. This affordability allows for the employment of more SOCOs, enhancing their accessibility and further proving their value.
Despite its strengths, the role has some drawbacks. The demanding hours and on-call nature of the job can make it socially undesirable. If fewer individuals apply for these roles in the future, their current high availability may decrease. Furthermore, the frequent exposure of SOCOs to hazardous materials may discourage individuals from pursuing or remaining in this profession. Another weakness is the potential for human error. Failure to follow evidence collection protocols can compromise investigations. For example, in the Amanda Knox case, investigators failed to wear protective clothing correctly, leading to evidence contamination and undermining the case. This highlights the importance of adherence to procedures, as errors can render SOCOs ineffective.
Highly educated and equipped with the necessary expertise, SOCOs perform their roles effectively. While the job does present challenges such as demanding hours and risks of human error, their strengths, including their knowledge, availability, and cost-effectiveness, make them an indispensable part of criminal investigations.
 
Forensic Scientists
 Forensic scientists play a crucial role in criminal investigations. They examine and analyse evidence collected by SOCOs (Scene of Crime Officers), providing essential information and data for police and court trials.
 One significant strength of forensic scientists is their high level of expertise. To work in this field, they must hold a degree in forensic science or a related scientific discipline. This extensive knowledge makes them highly effective in their roles. Additionally, forensics divides into specialised areas like toxicology or drug analysis. This specialisation ensures that forensic scientists focus on specific departments, further highlighting their expertise and enhancing their effectiveness. Moreover, forensic evidence is highly accurate, reducing the risk of wrongful convictions and increasing the likelihood of fair prosecutions, demonstrating the critical importance of their work.
 However, forensic scientists are not without their limitations. One major issue is the cost. Hiring forensic experts can be costly, as private firms often employ them instead of the police directly. Furthermore, a 2005 report revealed a shortage of forensic scientists in the UK, with only 3,000 professionals in this field. This scarcity can pose a significant challenge, especially when time constraints necessitate swift analysis of evidence. Another challenge is the potential for errors. For example, in the case of Adam Scott, a mistake at the testing centre led to his wrongful accusations of rape. The investigation later discovered a serious error when contaminated equipment incorrectly linked Adam Scott's DNA to a swab from the victim.
In conclusion, forensic scientists are indispensable in criminal investigations due to their qualifications and specialised skills, which makes them highly effective in their roles. However, their limited availability, high costs, and the potential for mistakes are factors that can sometimes hinder their overall effectiveness.
 
Police
 Another key type of personnel involved in criminal investigations is the police, who are often the first to arrive at a crime scene. Their primary responsibilities include preserving life, securing the crime scene, and safeguarding evidence. Additionally, police play a vital role in investigating and reducing crime.
One strength of the police is the requirement for education and qualifications to join the force. This ensures that officers possess a high level of expertise, making them effective in their duties. Another strength is their crucial role in protecting the public and assisting those in need. In the event of a serious injury, police officers would promptly summon an ambulance. They also contribute to public safety by detecting and preventing crime.
However, there are notable weaknesses within the police force. One issue is their limited availability, with only 211 officers per 100,000 people. This highlights a shortage of personnel to adequately cover the population. Similarly, budget cuts have significantly impacted policing, reducing the number of officers and leaving many crimes not investigated. There have also been instances of bias and prejudice within the police, raising concerns about institutional racism. A notable example is the case of Stephen Lawrence, where the police failed to recognise or act on the fact that his murder was a hate crime.
 
CPS
The Crown Prosecution Service is responsible for deciding whether to prosecute an offender, a task previously handled by the police until changes were introduced in 1986. The CPS consists of trained lawyers who review cases submitted by the police and assess whether they meet specific criteria, such as sufficient evidence and public interest in pursuing them.
One key strength of the CPS is their expertise. As trained lawyers, they follow a structured process to ensure fair and accurate decisions. Their independence from the police is another advantage, as it allows them to make impartial judgments. Additionally, the CPS operates 24/7 through CPS Direct, enabling the police to access support and advice at any time.
Despite their strengths, the CPS is not without its shortcomings. Statistics show errors occur in approximately 1 out of every 15 cases, highlighting that their decisions are not always accurate. A common issue is insufficient evidence, which leads to a high number of cases collapsing. Another weakness is the strained relationship between the CPS and the police, which can hinder their overall effectiveness and disrupt the prosecution process.
 
 
 
Forensic Pathologist
Forensic pathologists are responsible for conducting autopsies and determining the cause of death.
One significant strength is that they initially train as doctors before specialising in pathology, ensuring they are highly skilled and knowledgeable. This level of expertise makes their findings reliable and trustworthy. Additionally, forensic pathologists play a crucial role in uncovering key evidence related to the cause of death, which is often vital to solving cases. Their availability, as they are available 24/7 to assist whenever needed, further enhances their effectiveness.
However, there are some notable weaknesses. Despite being available around the clock, their numbers are extremely limited, with only about 37 organisations in the UK employing forensic pathologists. This shortage makes availability a significant challenge. Furthermore, they often handle multiple cases simultaneously, which could reduce their overall effectiveness. Another downside is the cost—earning around £100,000 annually, forensic pathologists represent a significant expense. Mistakes can also occur, as demonstrated in the Anthony Hardy case. In this instance, a pathologist, Dr. Patel, mistakenly concluded that Hardy's first victim had died of natural causes. He failed to consider critical details such as the body's location, position, and surrounding blood evidence. This error ultimately led to a finding of professional incompetence against the pathologist.
 
AC 1.2 - Assess the Usefulness of Investigative Techniques in Criminal Investigations
 
Forensics
Forensics is a common investigative technique in criminal investigations that involves experts analysing evidence collected from crime scenes. Forensic analysis includes fingerprint identification. Forensic specialists can match fingerprint samples from suspects to those discovered at the crime scene. This technique's key strength is its high reliability, as each individual has a unique fingerprint. Additionally, police can extract DNA from blood samples found at the scene. For example, in the case of Colin Pitchfork, the police obtained blood samples from all the men in the neighbourhood and were able to match Pitchfork's DNA to that of the murder victims.

Another significant advantage is that forensic techniques can exonerate innocent people. For instance, over 250 people in the United States have had their convictions overturned by DNA evidence. The constant evolution of new methods allows for the identification of criminals through DNA matches with relatives. Furthermore, DNA testing has helped solve historical cases like Colette Aram's.

Experts in forensic analysis must follow strict protocols to prevent contamination of the evidence, which is another advantage. However, one disadvantage of forensic techniques, such as DNA testing, is their high cost. Furthermore, they are not always completely accurate, which could jeopardise their reliability. Another limitation is the possibility of contamination, as seen in the case of Adam Scott.

Laboratory settings, where analysis takes place, are where forensic techniques are most useful. In cases of violent and street crimes, forensic samples always require testing for identification, making them especially useful.
 
Surveillance
Surveillance is one type of investigative technique, which includes CCTV cameras that police can use to track down victims and offenders. Another example is the use of covert human intelligence sources, where officers go undercover to establish a relationship with the target in order to obtain information. For example, in the case of Colin Stagg, the police set up a 'honey trap, in which a female officer pretended to be interested in him.

One advantage of CCTV is that it provides a visual record, making it more reliable than eyewitness testimony. CCTV has the potential to deter crime by making individuals reconsider their actions when they are aware they are being recorded. Public media can also release CCTV surveillance footage, encouraging people to identify or report anyone they recognize. This can be quite useful for investigations.

According to a study by the Metropolitan Police Department, surveillance only solves one out of every 1000 cases. This implies that CCTV only solves 3% of crimes, a relatively small number of cases. This suggests that the use of CCTV is not particularly beneficial. Another weakness is that surveillance may include undercover work, which could be dangerous and risky for those involved. Furthermore, it does not actually solve the crime but instead causes it to be displaced, which demonstrates that it is not very useful.

CCTV is best used on streets and where crimes may occur to catch violent crime or street crimes as evidence.
 
Interview techniques
Another investigative technique is interview techniques, which fall under the category of eyewitness testimony or expert testimony. Both provide interviews and a verbal statement about the case. Investigations call experts to interpret the evidence and assess its accuracy. For example, medical experts can provide information on the cause of death. Police investigators use cognitive interviewing in conjunction with eyewitness testimony to ensure accurate evidence. Fisher and Greiselman identified four basic principles for improving memory. They include reporting everything, recalling in different orders, reinstating context, and recalling from various perspectives. This can increase the usefulness of eyewitness testimony by developing accuracy in investigations. 

One advantage is their widespread use and acceptance. Many convictions have been based on eyewitness testimony, demonstrating their usefulness as reliable and high-quality evidence. Eyewitness testimony and experts also help investigations because they provide clues about where and what to look for, which can save time. Another strength is that experts have knowledge and qualifications to provide accurate responses. These advantages indicate that interview techniques are effective investigative methods. 

However, anxiety and stress can affect interview techniques, making statements less reliable. Anxiety and stress have also been associated with miscarriages of justice. Consider the case of Ronald Cotton, who was wrongfully imprisoned for 10 years for crimes he did not commit and whose convictions were based on flawed eyewitness testimony.

Interview techniques would be most useful in a police station or courtroom where evidence is heard and collected, and they would be helpful for a variety of crimes. For instance, violent crime.
 
Profiling Offenders
Criminal investigators use profiling as a technique, believing that by assessing the offence, they can determine the characteristics of the offender. This means that case investigators would use their knowledge of the details to create a description of what they believe the offender would look like.

The advantages of this are that it allows investigators to solve a crime quickly and affordably. Another advantage is that in some cases, offender profiling has helped solve a crime. For example, in the case of a railway rapist, David Canter developed an offender profile, and John Duffy matched 13 of the 17 characteristics. He was then found guilty. The usefulness of offender profiling lies in its ability to predict future offences and facilitate early apprehension of offenders, thereby preventing future victims. This also allows police to prioritise suspects and target resources. David Canter, who caught John Duffy and David Mulcahy, the railway rapists, also used geographic profiling to determine the approximate location of an offender.

One disadvantage of offender profiling is that it can result in a miscarriage of justice. For instance, the profile mistakenly identified Colin Stagg as an offender, despite his innocence. Creating an incorrect profile can lead to delays in investigations and waste of time, which is another disadvantage. They also only worked 46% of the time, indicating inefficiency.

A police station would employ this kind of strategy, which would be particularly helpful in situations of street crime or violence.
 
Intelligence databases
Police use databases to store and access information. The Metropolitan Police Service manages Criminit, a database that stores information about criminals and suspected criminals. There are other databases with information from previous witnesses, informants, and criminal shows.

With data, it can solve crimes and deter and prevent them. It can also be an effective tool for making connections and solving crimes. For example, tracing offenders using DNA. Also, having databases readily available saves time and resources.

One issue is that the potential compromise of this personal information raises serious ethical concerns. There is also the possibility of human error. For example, submitting incorrect information. This may result in inaccurate findings and, in some cases, miscarriages of justice. There is also the question of data misuse by police officials, who may take advantage and use it for various purposes. For example, there are numerous cases of police selling the addresses of people who are in witness protection.
 
 
Describe the processing of evidence in AC 1.3.
Physical evidence refers to authentic and tangible items found at a crime scene that can be used to identify a suspect. This may include blood, DNA, hair, or footprints. Footprints are a form of physical evidence. Initially, we capture and preserve images to pinpoint the precise location of the footprints at the crime scene. There are two methods to harvest them. One method is to use a white light to make the footprints more visible and take pictures with a camera, and if the footprint is left outside in mud, a clay cast can be produced and compared to the suspects' shoes. Footprints are collected by SOCOs. To ensure a smooth transfer to the laboratory, we must properly and safely preserve the footprints. We will store them in sterile containers and tag them with crime data to guarantee their return to the relevant department. Professionals take them to a laboratory where they examine the imprints. Experts can study and analyse them to identify unique impressions of shoe insoles. Experts can study and analyse them to identify unique impressions of shoe insoles. Experts can study and analyse them to identify unique impressions of shoe insoles. There is also a database that compares print patterns to shoes. Each stage of the procedure requires a separate set of workers. For example, the SOCOS will collect the evidence, while an expert will examine it. One example of the usage of collecting footprints is the case of Amanda Knox, in which the investigators failed to wear protective clothing, and, when they did wear shoe coverings, they did not remove them when they stepped outdoors, resulting in unreliable footprint recordings.

Another type of physical evidence is hair and fibre samples taken by SOCOs, who wear bodysuits to prevent their own clothing and hair from contaminating the evidence. Hairs are placed in DNA tubes and sealed, whereas fibres can be collected using adhesive tape and placed on paper before being placed in an evidence bag. Once gathered, marked evidence bags must be submitted to the lab separately to prevent contamination. Hair and fibres are examined by experts in the lab using a microscope, and toxicology tests can be performed to detect drug use. Sarah Pain, for example, had her hair and material fibre from a jumper found in the suspect's van. Fibres on her shoe matched the passenger seat cover in the van, and her hair was detected on the jumper. Roy Whiting, the suspect, was found guilty of abducting and murdering a young child.
 
AC 1.4 - Examine the rights of individuals in criminal investigations

The Rights of Suspects
The Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1984 establishes suspects' rights.When arrested, PACE requires that suspects be told of all facts about their arrest by the officer. When individuals arrive at the police station, they will be directed to a custody officer who will explain their rights, and they may be released within 24 hours in some cases. According to PACE, suspects have three major rights while in custody: the right to free legal assistance from a solicitor, the right to a copy of police rules and a written notice of rights, and the right to have someone informed of their arrest. If someone is under the age of 18, an adult must be present. Another right they have while in custody is to be searched by someone of the same gender. They may also be fingerprinted and questioned, but they have a "right to silence" in the warning read to them by police as they are detained. They are not required to talk, but everything they do or do not say may be used against them. If they are tried in a magistrate's court, they have the opportunity to appeal their verdict or punishment. If tried in the crown court, appeals are not automatic and must be granted by a judge.

The Rights of Victims

The Victims Code of Practice 2006 outlines victims' rights. Their first rights are exercised while reporting a crime, when police must provide them with a crime number, confirmation, and contact information for the officer investigating the case. They should also be kept informed about the progress of the investigation and given the option of writing a victim personal statement. Victims have the right to privacy; thus, if the police need to include media during the investigation, they must obtain the victim's consent beforehand. And providing information regarding crimes such as sexual assault is against the law. During the trial, they have the right to be told by CPS of the date and place of the trial, and the victim will be notified of the case's outcome by a witness care officer within 24 hours. In some situations, a victim may be classified as a vulnerable victim and may be provided further assistance in terms of accessing information more swiftly and being assisted if they are required as a witness. For example, if they are under the age of 18, have a handicap, or suffer from mental disease.

Witness' Rights

Witness rights are outlined in the Witness Charter 2008, which is not legally enforceable but serves as a guide for authorities uncovering information during trials and investigations. All witnesses shall be given the right to contact someone who will keep them up to speed on the status of the case, and witnesses should be made aware of any relevant information in advance so that they may better prepare. If a witness is fragile or likely to be intimidated while testifying, specific safeguards will be in place to protect them. For example, testimony evidence can be provided via a video link hidden behind a screen to protect their identity.

AC 2.1 - Explain the requirements of the Crown Prosecution Service for prosecuting suspects

The CPS is a government-run organization that controls the prosecution of suspects. Their primary role is to decide if there is enough evidence to prosecute a criminal and if it is in the public interest. They took over this role from the police in 1986 due to the Prosecution of Offences Act, which set up the CPS, to try and reduce bias as the police would both investigate and prosecute the suspects. The prosecution of suspects was allowed by the 2003 Criminal Justice Act which meant the CPS could set a court date and prepare to prosecute the suspect.
To decide if there is enough evidence to prosecute, the CPS uses a series of tests. The first of these is the Full Code Test. This is the first test done and has two stages. The first one is the evidential stage. This is where the CPS looks at the evidence for and against the criminal and decides if there is enough to get a successful prosecution of the suspect. They also check whether the evidence provided is accurate, credible, and reliable. They will decide to prosecute the suspect if there is sufficient evidence and the suspect is likely to be found guilty in front of a judge.
If this stage is passed, the CPS will then move on to the Public Interest stage. During this portion of the test, they will decide whether it is in the public interest to prosecute. To do this they will look at what harm has been caused to the victim and any relevant information about the people's involved circumstances. The CPS may also look at whether a prosecution of the suspect will benefit the wider community. After completing both the evidential and public interest stages of the Full Code Test, they will decide whether the prosecution of the suspect is possible and if it is whether it is worth it.
If there is not enough evidence to prosecute the suspect, they will perform the second test, which is only possible if stage 1 in the Full Code Test failed. The second test is called the Threshold Test. During this, they will ask 5 questions to decide whether they can hold the suspect until a proper conviction can be made. These 5 questions are: Is there reasonable suspicion, Will there be any new evidence found, Is the crime serious enough, Is it in the public interest, and Are there any substantial grounds to object to bail. To pass this test it must meet all 5 of these conditions. This test allows an immediate charge decision when all evidence is not available and the suspect presents a bail risk.

 AC 2.2 - Describe trial processes

There are three types of offence and these are indictable, triable either way, and summary. Indictable offences are the most serious of all the offences which can only be dealt with by the Crown Court and are almost immediately passed there by the Magistrates' Court. Some examples of indictable offences are murder, rape, kidnapping and robbery, which all carry heavy charges due to their seriousness.
Triable either way offences can be tried either as indictable or a summary offence. This is usually based on the extent of the severity of the crime you have committed. Some examples of this could be aggravated bodily harm or burglary; how it is tried could be based on the value of what you stole.
Summary offences are minor criminal offences that are usually tried in a magistrates' court, as they are not as serious as other offences. This could include crimes such as traffic violations, petty theft, and public disorder.
The two types of court are the magistrates' court and the crown court. In a magistrates' court, all criminal cases are heard here and 95% are settled here, but if the crime is too serious it is passed on to the crown court. Summary offences like traffic violations, petty theft, and public disorder will be heard here. In a magistrates' court, there are usually three magistrates who are volunteers without any legal qualifications. There is also a clerk of the court, CPS to present the case, and a solicitor to defend the defendant. In a crown court, they deal with indictable or serious triable either way offences like murder rape and terrorism. In the crown court, the defence is represented by a barrister and a CPS agent represents the case against the defendant. The jury, which is 10 members of the public, listens to all evidence, and the judge decides the sentence if found guilty by the jury.
A plea is where the defendant will say if they are gulity or not guilty. A guilty ple means that they means they can pass a sentence immediately as they have admited that they did it, a non guilty plea means they have not accepted that they done it and a trial goes ahead to decide if they did commit the crime.
Bail allows criminals to not be in prison but be released, usually with conditions. This could be something like an ankle monitor, no access to the internet, or a rehab program. Granting bail means that the court and the defendant have agreed on terms, and he is released. Refusing bail means no agreement could be reached, and the defendant will be sent to prison. The two types of bail are conditional, where there is a condition, and unconditional, where there are no conditions.
Appealing a conviction is a predetermined right of all individuals who have been convicted of an offence. The crown court hears appeals from the magistrates court. The Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal receives appeals from the crown court. The Supreme Court, also known as the House of Lords, is the highest court in the system. It is exclusively employed in cases that pertain to legal matters of general public significance. 






AC 2.3 - Understand the rules in relation to the use of evidence in criminal cases

Relevance and admissibility
All evidence must be relevant, reliable, and admissible in court, as stated by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. In order to be relevant, the evidence must be explicitly related to the incident and applicable to the specific case. Furthermore, it must be logical and either support or disprove the case facts. Admissibility is the extent to which the evidence that will be presented in the trial is acceptable demonstrating that it is both relatable and accurately obtained. The process by which evidence would be rediscovered if the incident were to recur would the same results be obtained is reliability. For example, DNA must be 100% accurate and reliable, and eyewitness testimony must be corroborative with the accounts of other individuals. Confessional evidence that is obtained as a result of oppression or other circumstances that could render confessions unreliable or fraudulent must be excluded by the courts. Consequently, evidence that has been obtained through coercion or entrapment must be excluded. For example, Lizzie, a covert police officer, attempted to persuade Collin Stagg to produce evidence that implicated him in a homicide. Furthermore, the Criminal Justice Act (2003) does not always allow the use of prior convictions as evidence; however, there are circumstances in which they may be admissible in court. This allows the provision of prior convictions to demonstrate whether the defence has the potential to commit offences of the same nature as those for which they are being accused.

Disclosure of Evidence.
Both the prosecution and defence are obligated to disclose all evidence they uncover to one another. This is done to ensure that the trial is impartial and that the outcome is accurate in accordance with the evidence. This shows the shared commitment of everyone involved in the criminal justice system, who ensure that this regulation is strictly enforced in all circumstances. The prosecution's failure to disclose medical information that could have been used as a defence in the case of Sally Clark resulted in her conviction being overturned three years later. This demonstrates how failure to disclose information can lead to miscarriages of justice.

Hearsay rule and exemptions
Hearsay evidence is any statement made outside of court that is not admissible as evidence. However, parties can use hearsay evidence if they are convinced that it is in the public interest or if the individual who made the statement is vulnerable, dead or lives abroad. Amanda Knox is a prime example of unsubstantiated evidence, as it was reported that she and her fiancé were engaged in physical altercations at the time of their murder charges.

Barristers and Legal Teams
Barristers and legal teams can occasionally significantly impact a case. Efran (1974) proposes that good-looking criminals will frequently receive lesser sentences unless their appearance was a contributing factor to their crime. This implies that it is also feasible for a fine-looking barrister to attract the jury's attention as a result of their appearance. However, this may also entail that a barrister will provide the defendant with guidance on how to dress, and may even purchase clothing for them to bolster their case. The influence of high-quality barristers and legal teams on a case is frequently greater, despite the fact that not everyone has the financial means to afford such defence. The family was not entitled to legal aid during the private prosecution, as was the case with Stephen Lawrence. Consequently, a fund was established to cover court expenditures.

Experts
An expert is an individual who has received specialised training and possesses a high level of knowledge in a specific field. A trial could be significantly influenced by the opinion of an expert. Statistics and technical terms are frequently employed in their evidence, which enhances the precision of their statements. This is a significant advantage of relying on the opinions of experts. An expert may also provide a list of their qualifications when they take the stand to enhance their credibility. This is also an advantage, as they are knowledgeable individuals who are more likely to provide accurate information. Due to these factors, the jury may be influenced, as they lack specialised knowledge and will be impressed by the testimony of experts, which will be perceived as valid and accurate. However, this could result in a vulnerability, as errors in the testimony could result in an incorrect verdict or a miscarriage of justice. In the case of Sally Clark, Sir Roy Meadows, an expert paediatrician, expressed his belief that the mother had suffocated their children to death, rather than the accurate explanation of SIDS. He testified that the probability of two children dying from SIDS was 1 in 73 million. This resulted in the jury concluding that Sally Clark was culpable, and she was unjustly imprisoned, resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Another advantage is that the expert may be able to comprehend and elucidate technical evidence to the jury, thereby providing them with a more comprehensive understanding. But experts may not always be accurate and may mislead the jury, which underscores another vulnerability. 




AC 2.5 - Discuss the use of laypeople in criminal cases

Jury

There are two methods by which laypeople can be employed in criminal cases. Jurors, who are members of the public without legal expertise, are one manner in which laypeople are employed to determine the outcome of a case. In the Juries Act 1974 and the Criminal Justice Act 2003, eligibility for jury selection and qualification is specified. Jurors are randomly selected from the electoral register and must satisfy the following criteria: they must be between the ages of 18 and 75, have a residency requirement of five years or more, have no recent criminal convictions, and not be mentally deranged. Frequently, 15 individuals are randomly selected, and 12 of them will be appointed to serve on the case. As directed by the magistrate, they are typically required to reach a unanimous decision or a majority decision (10 out of 12).

Jury equity is a concept that refers to the fact that juries occasionally incorporate their own beliefs and sense of impartiality into the deliberation of a case. For instance, in R v Owen, the defendant's son was fatally injured by a negligent motorist whose vehicle was neither insured nor roadworthy. Additionally, the motorist was blind and lacked a valid driver's license. Owen was accused with attempted homicide after shooting the driver. Owen was acquitted by the jury on the basis of morals, despite his evident culpability. Subsequently, some jury members expressed their praise for Owen, as they believed they would have acted similarly. In the same vein, Ponting discovered evidence in R v Ponting that the government had falsely informed the public about the grounding of a ship during the Falklands War. He then forwarded the document to an opposing party in order to ensure that the issue was addressed in Parliament. The jury acquitted him of the charges brought against him under the Official Secrets Act, as they concluded that the information should have been made public.

In both instances, the jury defied the law and rendered an innocent verdict for the defendant, despite the existence of obvious evidence of culpability. This is a virtue of the jury system, as it illustrates the various methods by which justice can be maintained. It is probable that the defendants would have been convicted of the crime if the verdict had been determined by the judge; however, the jury's decision prevented them from being charged with the offence.

However, many juries' advantages can also be abused as disadvantages. For instance, jurors may intentionally pursue their own interests or beliefs and render a verdict that is at odds with the evidence, as they are not required to provide an explanation for their verdicts. In R v Kronlid, the defendants destroyed an aircraft to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack. Despite the evidence that they did so, a jury found the defendants not guilty. In the same vein, the defendants in R v Randle and Pottle were charged 25 years after assisting a Soviet agent in evading imprisonment and returning to Russia. The defendants acknowledged their culpability, but they were nonetheless proud of their actions. They delivered passionate speeches in their own behalf, contending that the legal system was abused by bringing them to court 25 years after the offence. Despite being aware that they were delivering a perverse verdict, the jury was impressed by their actions and acquitted them.

Jurors may also introduce their own biases into deliberations, as evidenced by the case of Sander v UK, in which racial bias was evident. The judge permitted the jury to continue, despite the fact that certain members of the jury made explicit bigoted remarks and comments about the defendant. The trial's outcome may have been affected by this bias. Furthermore, jurors are commonplace individuals who may not comprehend intricate legal concepts, even when judges have clarified them. This may imply that certain individuals may find certain aspects of cases challenging to comprehend, and their perspectives will not be adequately considered during jury deliberations. Consequently, the jury may not be completely representative or qualified to render a verdict. This is especially true in cases of fraud or lengthy and intricate trials, which may lead to miscarriages of justice or the acquittal of culpable defendants.

Magistrates
Another method of employing ordinary people is as magistrates, who are also referred to as justices of the peace. They are 18 and 65 years old and are responsible for determining whether the case presented to them has substantiated the prosecution's case, as well as determining the appropriate sentence. They are not compensated; however, they are entitled to receive assistance and instruction, as well as a legally qualified clerk to guarantee that they are cognisant of all applicable laws and adhere to them. This method is significantly less expensive than traditional court procedures, which benefits the justice system, as magistrates are volunteers. The government would incur millions of pounds annually if such procedures were executed by qualified prosecutors, solicitors, or judges. This could potentially affect cases and tribunals at the highest echelons of the hierarchy. Nevertheless, it is logical to allocate less funding to this area as magistrates handle less severe cases.

Additionally, the fact that they are volunteers gives them a more common and representative perspective on the population, as some of them have similar origins to the defendants. This implies that their perspectives are more valuable than those of professional judges, as they possess a more comprehensive understanding of the context of criminal activity. For instance, a magistrate who was raised in a working-class or impoverished environment will be able to empathise with an individual who shoplifted to provide for their children. Furthermore, the general public is more accurately represented by the approximately 50% female magistrates, as only 30% of jurors are female.

Approximately 95% of all criminal cases are heard by magistrates, as the majority of cases are resolved through their tribunals. However, the fact that there are so few appeals from their decision suggests that their sentencing is both effective and ethical, despite the significant number. But magistrates' inconsistent behaviour is one of their most significant concerns. Frequently, defendants who have committed the same offence are issued varying sentences or no sentence at all within the same court or across various magistrates' courts in the United Kingdom. This is a concern because inconsistent sentencing may cause some defendants to feel as though they have been unjustly punished when compared to someone who committed the same offence, which could potentially lead to an increase in the number of appeals.

For instance, Bristol magistrates administered custodial sentences to 11.1% of defendants, while Dinefwr magistrates administered custodial sentences to only 0.1% of defendants. Additionally, it is alleged that there is a bias in benefit of the police, as a significant number of magistrates are middle-aged and middle-class. The majority of individuals in this category are retired, which means they have ample leisure time due to their lack of employment obligations. As magistrates are also unpaid volunteers, it is most probable that middle-class individuals will pursue this position, as they already have sufficient funds to support their existing lifestyle. Additionally, there have been numerous initiatives to broaden the diversity of magistrates, including the recruitment of individuals from working-class backgrounds and younger individuals. Even so, the age inequality remains in effect.

Furthermore, some magistrates have been accused of being biassed against defendants, potentially due to the age and class disparities. This could potentially influence the decision-making of magistrates, who may be more inclined to support the prosecution, as they may encounter the same prosecutors on a regular basis. It is also believed that the same magistrates may become callous if they consistently discharge this role for an extended period.
